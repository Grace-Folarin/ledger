          <h3 class="mt-0">Our software is helping build a grid that works for everyone</h3>
          <p>The world is in a transition to new kinds of energy. But bringing that about is not as simple as just flicking on some switches to feed rooftop solar into the grid.</p>
          <p>At Energy Ledger, we have developed a way of integrating traditional energies with renewables, batteries with hydro and the peaks with the troughs.</p>
          <p>It’s the operating system for new energy markets and the power systems that they control.</p>
          <p>In this new world there are two new concepts: A digital identity for every electrical resource or power device, and a real time market that facilitates the transactions between them.</p>
          <p>Our platform allows devices and humans to trade the power they need, when they need it, simply and in a way that's scalable for the entire energy system.</p>

            Managing the grid, stripping out cost</h3>
         <p>Our platform is making a big difference</p>
         <p>The central problems in electrical generation are high supply during the day and high demand in the evening. This is often called the duck curve</p>
         <p>You can store that problem away with hydro or batteries and you can trade it away. But you can’t ignore it.</p>
         <p>When you use the Energy Ledger platform, you are helping to stabilize the grid and helping to make renewables work for all of us. You are also reducing your costs</p>
         <ul>
             <li>µGrid: Manage your microgrid with a real time market that optimises price</li>
             <li>xGrid: Sell and buy excess kilowatt hours across the grid, and help stabilise it at the same time</li>
             <li>Balance VPP: Manage the peaks and troughs with a battery and make a profit in the process.</li>
             <li>MODE: Flexibilities marketplace for network operators to stabilise their grids.</li>
             <li>Vision: Choose the type and quality of energy you are sourcing. Wind, solar or traditional</li>
             <li>PPA Vision: Manage the output, billing and settlement for commercial solar and wind farms</li>
             <li>PPA Exchange: Making renewables PPAs seamless.</li>
             <li>Trace: Tracks and traces the life of renewable energy certificates (RECs).</li>
             <li>TraceX: Trade and settle RECs wherever you are in the world.</li>
             <p>Whichever features you select, they are all about real time action, high transparency, high control and high verifiability.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-0">Renewables are the solution and the problem</h3>
          <p>Midday oversupply of solar energy plays havoc with the grid and creates reverse flows to distribution networks. This can burnout transformers, cause harmonics and voltage outages and actually requires even more equipment to stabilize the grid.</p>
          <p>Oversupply puts more demand on grid ancillary services - which relate to frequency stability - and because these services are expensive, these costs go up.</p>
          <p>All of this activity makes it harder for the baseload generation to happen efficiently and costs go up too.</p>
          <p>These issues are being experienced in every market with high penetration of renewables - places such as California, Germany, Japan and Australia. It's clear a critical piece of the jigsaw is missing, one that will help manage the volatile nature of the grid. This piece wasn't needed when everything was thermal, but renewables require us to up our game.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-0">The internet of electricity</h3>
          <p>In this new conception of a grid, devices are no longer dumb. They have five attributes and enough intelligence to make their own decisions.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Device identifier</li>
              <li>Geolocation</li>
              <li>Blockchain ID</li>
              <li>Bid and offer based on need state</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On top of this layer is a market that allows for rapid real time transactions between ordinary household devices.</p>
          <p>We’re helping to create a world where devices make it part of their job to stabilise the grid.</p>
